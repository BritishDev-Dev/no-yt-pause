# No Youtube Pause

## Why?
Youtube will often pause your Music/Video when you are listening/watching consistantly for a long time. This is to reduce the bandwidth usage of Youtube but can often get annoying when you are listening to a video in the background while working.

## Solution
I provided this script for you to use with a script injector which will check every second if the box confirmation dialog has popped up and if it has it will click the "yes" button to confirm you want to continue "watching".

## Installation
Use a script injector such as the ones linked below to either inject the script from the URL or paste the [script.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BritishDev-Dev/no-yt-pause/master/script.js) contents into the injector.

[Chrome - Injector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/injector/bfdonckegflhbiamlmidciapolfccmmb?hl=en)
[Firefox - Code Injector](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/codeinjector/)
[Opera - TamperMonkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/tampermonkey-beta/)

## Disclaimer
I am in no way responsible if your account or IP get blocked or restricted from accessing Youtube services due to the use of this script. Youtube relies on ads to afford bandwidth and pay the youtube creators and other services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Youtube Music+ are available if you would like to support content creators who make music.
